         The real magic lies in the transformation of poll
         it starts as a Poll object but it's incomplete:
         
         we're taking the values submitted through a form
         (title, options, etc.), but that doesn't include the UUID
         that identifies this poll uniquely.
         
         That's because we can't expect (or trust!) users to provide
         such data, so it needs to be filled in by Fluent. When the save()
         method completes, Flient will automatically have filled in its UUID
         with a new, unique value, and it's safe to return.

    It returns 'Future<[Poll]>' which is an array of Poll
    objects. We already made the Poll struct conform to Content
    so it can be returned as JSON, and that automatically means
    arrays of polls can be returned as JSON.

         Running Poll.query() starts a Fluent search for Poll
         objects, which means we're able to search for polls that interest us.
         
         In this case we're using all(), which simply returns all polls, but in project 4
         I'll show you how to filter that list.
         
         Just like saving things, running queries returns a future because it won't complete
         immediately. There could potentially be thousands of polls to read and convert to JSON,
         so using a future means that work can happen in the background while Vapor goes back
         to processing other things.

/*
 
 Map(): When you use map() on a Future<A>, your closure will get called with the A
 so you can transofrm it to a B. When that gets returned it will automatically
 become a Future<B>.
 
 FlatMap(): When you use flatMap() on a Future<A>, your closure will get called with the A
 so you can transform it to a Future<B>. When that gets returned it _would_ have been a
 Future<Future<<B>>, but flatMap() flattens that into just Future<B>.
 
 Single run: 'If the thing you're returning from your closure is a future you should use
 flatMap(), otherwise use map().'
 
 Map transforms an array of values into an array of other values, and flatMap does the same thing
 but also flattens a result of nested collections into just a single array.
 
 FlatMap() is there to convert future futures into regular futures.
